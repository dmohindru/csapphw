fdopen open 2 stream on same sockfd, fdclose will close sockfd under stream. 
If you call fclose 2 stream on the same sockfd, the second fclose will fail.
Image one thread execute code and open 2 stream on fd N. after execution of line fclose(fpin); ,
program create another thread and execute the same code.
but after fclose(fpin); in thread 1, fd N is reusable again. assume thread 2 use the fd N again: thread 1
execute line fclose(fpout); close the fd that thread 2 is using. it'll cause something unpredicted result.
