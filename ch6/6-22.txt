Home work problem 6-22
----------------------
bit per tract
bpt = x * r * K
here K = bit per unit radius track
tracks per disk
tpd = (1-x) * r * M
here M = tracks per unit length
so total bit count on disk
tbc = bpt * tpd
tbc = x * r * K * (1-x) * r * M
tbc = r^2 * K * M * (1-x) * x

for x = 0.80, (1-x)*x = 0.160
for x = 0.75, (1-x)*x = 0.1875
for x = 0.50, (1-x)*x = 0.25
for x = 0.25, (1-x)*x = 0.1875 
for x = 0.10, (1-x)*x = 0.090

so from above observation x is maximum when x = 0.5
